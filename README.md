# High-Level-Synthesis-on-a-FFT-Butterfly-Algorithm

A high level synthesis done on a FFT butterfly algorithm from a given pseudocode converted to RTL level code in System Verilog. A PicoMIPS Architecture was built to implement the design. It was simulated on Modelsim, tested using a testbench, synthesized on Quartus, and uploaded on a FPGA for real life testing.
